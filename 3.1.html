            <p>
                There are 2 types of storage, primary storage and secondary storage. Examples of primary storages are RAM and ROM, which was talked about in chapter 1. This chapter is more focused on secondary storage.
            </p>
            <h3>What is backing up data?</h3>

            <p>
            <strong>Backing up</strong> refers to a form of copying files to a different medium (eg. flash drives, disk, tape) ahead of time incase of a problem with the main secondary storage. Doing it reguarly is a good process as it ensures you lose no files in the case of an accident. Backups are usually stored elsewhere from the main storage because of the chance of something like a fire spreading.
            </p>
            <p>Again, backing up your data could be useful against accidents (like fires) but could also be useful again hackers. Apart from all this, if files need to be used from a different device backing up would be significantly useful. <em>Virusus however, can still corrupt your backups.</em></strong></p>
