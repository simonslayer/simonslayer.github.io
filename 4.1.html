            <strong>A network is when a computer is connected to a multitude of other computers.</strong> An example of this could include work computers from the office sharing a network with a resource such as a printer or software. The basic use of a network is to allow computers to communicate with others. 
        </p>
        <p>  
            There are many devices that take use of networks, wether it would be to create them or simply use them. To name a few;
            <ol>Modems</ol>
            <ol>Hubs</ol>
            <ol>Bridges</ol>
            <ol>Routers</ol>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Every device on the internet is given an IP address (Internet Protocal address). This address is a 32-bit number written in the form;
            <ol>109.108.158.1</ol>
        </p>
        <p>Wifi and Bluetooth creates a form of wireless communication between different devices. Wifi recieves its information via a broadband connection while bluetooth recieves radio waves with a sound of 79 frequencies centered around a 2.45GHz frequency. </p>
